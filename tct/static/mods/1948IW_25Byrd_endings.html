No, you can keep this going, squeeze them by the necks until they’re practically begging for you, Byrd, or Russell to be the nominee, and then only then will you come strutting back to McGrath and his cronies. With four years to go until then, you have plenty of time to wring the best deal possible.

Or Dirksen, a major Republican conservative who aligns more with your own economic policies, yet has also expressed support for the NRA in many closed circles from what you can tell, but to roll back the New Deal he may be willing to shelve social progress.
