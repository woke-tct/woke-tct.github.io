<p>Reviewed by: Rebecca Altman, The Atlantic. Aired: September 27, 2008
<p>HBO’s deadlock is a ground breaking, spine tingling, bone chilling political drama, about the final days of the presidential election of the year 2000. Directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers franchise). This film shows what happens when a disorganized and fractious third party led by a loudmouth billionaire, is able to deadlock the single most important election of our lives.
<p>The Democrats are the main protagonists of this story, headed by Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Ron Klain, played by the always amazing Kevin Spacey. try in vain to broker a deal with the Reform Party, offering minor electoral reforms and lukewarm acknowledgments. But the Reform Party, emboldened by its surprise showing and furious at being sidelined, refuses to bend. A lesser film might vilify the Democrats' stubbornness, but Deadlock presents it as a tragic flaw in an otherwise noble effort.
<p>The Republican’s plotline is largely around their resistance to negotiations with the Reform party. With some wanting to take the initiative and block a Reform-Dem coalition. While others decide to not negotiate in hopes of the election going to congress. The latter’s gamble won out and Bush and Cheney win the election.
<p>The Reform party legal team have few scenes, though the few they have are the best part of the film. Future Senator Dean Barkely (played by John C. Reilly) and Roger Stone (played by Steve Buschemi) 
 have a delightful odd-couple dynamic, which is much needed in this film.
<p>While Deadlock doesn’t always stick its landing—some of the courtroom scenes feel recycled from some of Sorkin’s better work (like the West Wing, which I totally love). But regardless it's essential viewing for anyone who still believes it can’t happen here.

<p>Hollywood's most unstoppable action hero just performed his most surprising role yet: political savior. In a political upset that feels ripped straight from a summer blockbuster, Arnold Schwarzenegger has officially been elected Governor of California, defeating embattled Democratic incumbent Gray Davis and Republican State Senator Tom McClintock in the state’s historic recall election.<p>
<p>But beyond the star power, there’s another unexpected ripple effect: the sudden and unlikely boon to the small, yet still alive Reform Party.<p>
<P>So what’s going on? Is this a fluke, or are we witnessing the soft reboot of America’s favorite dysfunctional third party?<p>
<p>Arnold’s Reform backed campaign, branded as “California Can Be Back!”, combined movie star charisma with Perot-style populism, a dash of Ventura-style showmanship, and a whole lot of bilingual media blitzing. He outmaneuvered both Democratic incumbent Gray Davis and Republican challenger Tom McClintock, uniting disaffected moderates, suburban moms, and, yes, film fans.<p>
<p>Schwarzenegger’s policy agenda remains something of a mystery, his campaign was light on details but heavy on vibes. Still, early signs suggest he’ll focus on balancing the budget, pushing education reform, and introducing ballot initiatives to limit special interest influence. (Sound familiar?)<p>
<p>Whether he can govern effectively in a state as large and fractious as California remains to be seen. And whether this movie ends in a happy franchise revival, or a messy spin-off disaster, depends on what the next few years bring.<p>

<p>By Bill Carter | The New York Times | April 17, 2004
<p>In a gleaming Manhattan boardroom, under spotlights and soft-focus cameras, a group of bright-eyed political hopefuls pitch their bold ideas to a panel of judges. Their goal? To prove they have what it takes to lead a modern campaign with media savvy, message control, and the Trump touch.
<p>No, this isn’t a mock debate or a new civic engagement initiative. This is “The Candidate”, the runaway network hit from businessman, media mogul, and former presidential contender Donald J. Trump, who shocked the political establishment in 2000 with his surprisingly strong result. Now, in classic Trump fashion, he's turned his strong result into something far more powerful than a cabinet seat, a primetime throne.
<p>Airing Thursday nights on NBC, The Candidate draws over 15 million viewers a week. The premise is simple but irresistible: each week, aspiring campaign managers, speechwriters, or amateur politicians face off in political-themed challenges, from writing stump speeches to surviving rapid-fire interviews with actual journalists. At the end of each episode, Trump sits behind his signature desk and delivers the verdict in a tone that is part CEO, part Caesar: “You don’t have the message. You’re out.”
<p>The show has been praised as a creative mix of political education and entertainment, and even credited with boosting voter registration among 18–35-year-olds. But critics say that’s only half the story. The final episode of Season 1 saw the winner, a young Reform-aligned mayor from Utah, was awarded a $500,000 war chest and an endorsement from the Reform National Committee. His campaign for Congress begins this fall.
<p>There have been strong accusations of bias towards the Reform Party, with challenges putting focus on Reform Party issues and having more favorable judges like Governor Jesse Ventura. Trump, naturally, rejects the these accusations. “Of course the Reform Party does well. We have the best people. The smartest. The most independent thinkers.” In a country sick of stale politics, The Candidate is part education, part entertainment and all Trump.

        return `<h3>The Pataki Collapse and the Problem with Personality Politics</h3>
<p>By Jonathan Feldman | The Weekly Standard | November 7, 2002
<p>It’s official: Governor George Pataki is out, and Tom Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, and three-time gadfly candidate, is now the governor of New York.
<p>For those watching the steady unraveling of principled politics, this is not just a state-level fluke, it’s the second shockwave from Donald Trump’s failed 2000 presidential bid. Golisano, running under the banner of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the increasingly disruptive Reform Party, secured a narrow but decisive victory over both Pataki and Democrat Carl McCall. 
<p>Let’s be clear: Golisano didn’t win because of conservative values, policy competence, or governing vision. He won because he ran on celebrity, grievance, and campaign flash, a model perfected by Trump two years ago when he was the Reform Party’s standard bearer. Backed again by the ever-scheming Roger Stone, and the so called comedian Randy Credico. Golisano’s slick operation flooded local airwaves with marijuana and lies.
<p>Golisano's victory is being celebrated as a win for “outsiders” and “the little guy.” But for those of us who believe in ideas over iconoclasm, the real danger isn’t Golisano, it’s what his win signals: that the Reform Party, long thought buried with Ross Perot’s last infomercial, has found new life in Trump’s shadow. Make no mistake: Golisano’s win is not a mandate. It’s a split decision in a fractured three-way race. Pataki, a two-term Republican with a strong economic record and a firm stance on national security, was dragged down by apathy, confusion, and Golisano’s blank-check populism.
<p>Golisano may sit in Albany now, but he brings no movement, no mandate, only momentum. And that momentum increasingly resembles the Trump-Perot axis: wealthy populists running on outsider bravado, bypassing party institutions, and winning by outspending and outshouting everyone else. The Reform Party may still be a fringe force in national politics, but if this trend continues, it could become a permanent spoiler. Worse still, it could replace serious conservatism with a populist circus.

        return `<h3>The Death of Hope: How America Chose Chaos Over Obama</h3>
<p>By Marla Eisenstein | The Progressive | November 5, 2008
<p>I can barely type these words.
<p>Donald J. Trump, real estate slum lord, tabloid sideshow, and architect of the most toxic campaign in modern American history, is now President-Elect of the United States. His running mate? Jesse “The Body” Ventura, former pro wrestler, conspiracy theorist, and somehow former two time Governor. Together, they didn’t just upset the election, they shattered every rule, every norm, and every fragile hope we had for the future.
<p>Barack Obama, once hailed as the new face of America, calm, poised, brilliant, was undone by a two-front war: John McCain’s meek centrism on the right, and Trump’s scorched-earth populism from left, right, and center on every channel, billboard, and paranoid radio show in the country. Trump called Obama a “Kenyan-born sleeper agent.” He aired ads claiming “Senator Hussein prays to Mecca, not God.” He dragged the discourse into the gutter and America dove in after him.
<p>Ventura’s speech last night mentioned the “Deep State” five times. Trump’s campaign has already announced “The Patriot Recovery Plan,” a shadowy combination of tariffs, mass firings, and a “full investigation” into Senator Obama’s “real past.”
<p>We were supposed to make history with Barack Obama. We were supposed to have a Black president. Instead, we’ve elected a man who spent the last decade yelling at Rosie O’Donnell and bankrupting casinos and leading a party including every weirdo on the political spectrum.
<p>Trump’s victory is not just a political failure it’s a moral one. We allowed our institutions to be eroded by celebrity, conspiracies, and rage. And now we must live with the consequences.

            "endingText": "<h3>HBO’s Deadlock (2008) Review: A Chilling Look at the Year Democracy Flinched</h3>\n<p>Reviewed by: Rebecca Altman, The Atlantic. Aired: September 27, 2008\n<p>HBO’s deadlock is a ground breaking, spine tingling, bone chilling political drama, about the final days of the presidential election of the year 2000. Directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers franchise). This film shows what happens when a disorganized and fractious third party led by a loudmouth billionaire, is able to deadlock the single most important election of our lives.\n<p>The Democrats are the main protagonists of this story, headed by Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Ron Klain, played by the always amazing Kevin Spacey. try in vain to broker a deal with the Reform Party, offering minor electoral reforms and lukewarm acknowledgments. But the Reform Party, emboldened by its surprise showing and furious at being sidelined, refuses to bend. A lesser film might vilify the Democrats' stubbornness, but Deadlock presents it as a tragic flaw in an otherwise noble effort.\n<p>The Republican’s plotline is largely around their resistance to negotiations with the Reform party. With some wanting to take the initiative and block a Reform-Dem coalition. While others decide to not negotiate in hopes of the election going to congress. The latter’s gamble won out and Bush and Cheney win the election.\n<p>The Reform party legal team have few scenes, though the few they have are the best part of the film. Future Senator Dean Barkely (played by John C. Reilly) and Roger Stone (played by Steve Buschemi) \n have a delightful odd-couple dynamic, which is much needed in this film.\n<p>While Deadlock doesn’t always stick its landing—some of the courtroom scenes feel recycled from some of Sorkin’s better work (like the West Wing, which I totally love). But regardless it's essential viewing for anyone who still believes it can’t happen here.\n",

In a political upset that feels ripped straight from a summer blockbuster, Arnold Schwarzenegger has officially been elected Governor of California, defeating embattled Democratic incumbent Gray Davis and Republican State Senator Tom McClintock in the state’s historic recall election.<p>\n<p>But beyond the star power, there’s another unexpected ripple effect: the sudden and unlikely boon to the small, yet still alive Reform Party.<p>\n<P>So what’s going on? Is this a fluke, or are we witnessing the soft reboot of America’s favorite dysfunctional third party?<p>\n<p>Arnold’s Reform backed campaign, branded as “California Can Be Back!”, combined movie star charisma with Perot-style populism, a dash of Ventura-style showmanship, and a whole lot of bilingual media blitzing. He outmaneuvered both Democratic incumbent Gray Davis and Republican challenger Tom McClintock, uniting disaffected moderates, suburban moms, and, yes, film fans.<p>\n<p>Schwarzenegger’s policy agenda remains something of a mystery, his campaign was light on details but heavy on vibes. Still, early signs suggest he’ll focus on balancing the budget, pushing education reform, and introducing ballot initiatives to limit special interest influence. (Sound familiar?)<p>\n<p>Whether he can govern effectively in a state as large and fractious as California remains to be seen. And whether this movie ends in a happy franchise revival, or a messy spin-off disaster, depends on what the next few years bring.<p>\n",

Their goal? To prove they have what it takes to lead a modern campaign with media savvy, message control, and the Trump touch.\n<p>No, this isn’t a mock debate or a new civic engagement initiative. This is “The Candidate”, the runaway network hit from businessman, media mogul, and former presidential contender Donald J. Trump, who shocked the political establishment in 2000 with his surprisingly strong result. Now, in classic Trump fashion, he's turned his strong result into something far more powerful than a cabinet seat, a primetime throne.\n<p>Airing Thursday nights on NBC, The Candidate draws over 15 million viewers a week. The premise is simple but irresistible: each week, aspiring campaign managers, speechwriters, or amateur politicians face off in political-themed challenges, from writing stump speeches to surviving rapid-fire interviews with actual journalists. At the end of each episode, Trump sits behind his signature desk and delivers the verdict in a tone that is part CEO, part Caesar: “You don’t have the message. You’re out.”\n<p>The show has been praised as a creative mix of political education and entertainment, and even credited with boosting voter registration among 18–35-year-olds. But critics say that’s only half the story. The final episode of Season 1 saw the winner, a young Reform-aligned mayor from Utah, was awarded a $500,000 war chest and an endorsement from the Reform National Committee. His campaign for Congress begins this fall.\n<p>There have been strong accusations of bias towards the Reform Party, with challenges putting focus on Reform Party issues and having more favorable judges like Governor Jesse Ventura. Trump, naturally, rejects the these accusations. “Of course the Reform Party does well. We have the best people. The smartest. The most independent thinkers.” In a country sick of stale politics, The Candidate is part education, part entertainment and all Trump.\n\n\n",

            "endingText": "<h3>The Pataki Collapse and the Problem with Personality Politics</h3>\n<p>By Jonathan Feldman | The Weekly Standard | November 7, 2002\n<p>It’s official: Governor George Pataki is out, and Tom Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, and three-time gadfly candidate, is now the governor of New York.\n<p>For those watching the steady unraveling of principled politics, this is not just a state-level fluke, it’s the second shockwave from Donald Trump’s failed 2000 presidential bid. Golisano, running under the banner of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the increasingly disruptive Reform Party, secured a narrow but decisive victory over both Pataki and Democrat Carl McCall. \n<p>Let’s be clear: Golisano didn’t win because of conservative values, policy competence, or governing vision. He won because he ran on celebrity, grievance, and campaign flash, a model perfected by Trump two years ago when he was the Reform Party’s standard bearer. Backed again by the ever-scheming Roger Stone, and the so called comedian Randy Credico. Golisano’s slick operation flooded local airwaves with marijuana and lies.\n<p>Golisano's victory is being celebrated as a win for “outsiders” and “the little guy.” But for those of us who believe in ideas over iconoclasm, the real danger isn’t Golisano, it’s what his win signals: that the Reform Party, long thought buried with Ross Perot’s last infomercial, has found new life in Trump’s shadow. Make no mistake: Golisano’s win is not a mandate. It’s a split decision in a fractured three-way race. Pataki, a two-term Republican with a strong economic record and a firm stance on national security, was dragged down by apathy, confusion, and Golisano’s blank-check populism.\n<p>Golisano may sit in Albany now, but he brings no movement, no mandate, only momentum. And that momentum increasingly resembles the Trump-Perot axis: wealthy populists running on outsider bravado, bypassing party institutions, and winning by outspending and outshouting everyone else. The Reform Party may still be a fringe force in national politics, but if this trend continues, it could become a permanent spoiler. Worse still, it could replace serious conservatism with a populist circus.\n\n",

Trump, real estate slum lord, tabloid sideshow, and architect of the most toxic campaign in modern American history, is now President-Elect of the United States. His running mate? Jesse “The Body” Ventura, former pro wrestler, conspiracy theorist, and somehow former two time Governor. Together, they didn’t just upset the election, they shattered every rule, every norm, and every fragile hope we had for the future.\n<p>Barack Obama, once hailed as the new face of America, calm, poised, brilliant, was undone by a two-front war: John McCain’s meek centrism on the right, and Trump’s scorched-earth populism from left, right, and center on every channel, billboard, and paranoid radio show in the country. Trump called Obama a “Kenyan-born sleeper agent.” He aired ads claiming “Senator Hussein prays to Mecca, not God.” He dragged the discourse into the gutter and America dove in after him.\n<p>Ventura’s speech last night mentioned the “Deep State” five times. Trump’s campaign has already announced “The Patriot Recovery Plan,” a shadowy combination of tariffs, mass firings, and a “full investigation” into Senator Obama’s “real past.”\n<p>We were supposed to make history with Barack Obama. We were supposed to have a Black president. Instead, we’ve elected a man who spent the last decade yelling at Rosie O’Donnell and bankrupting casinos and leading a party including every weirdo on the political spectrum.\n<p>Trump’s victory is not just a political failure it’s a moral one. We allowed our institutions to be eroded by celebrity, conspiracies, and rage. And now we must live with the consequences.\n",
